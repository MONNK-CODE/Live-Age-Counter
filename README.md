## Live Age Calculator
This is a simple, modern web page that displays a person's age, calculated in real-time down to the millisecond. The page is built with HTML, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript.

Features
- Real-time Updates: The age counter updates every 50 milliseconds.
- High Precision: The age is calculated to nine decimal places.
- Modern Design: A clean, dark-themed UI that is fully responsive.
- Built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How It Works
The JavaScript code calculates the difference in milliseconds between the current time and a hardcoded birthdate. This difference is then converted into years (accounting for leap years by using an average of 365.25 days per year) and displayed on the page. A setInterval function continuously re-runs this calculation to create the live-updating effect.
